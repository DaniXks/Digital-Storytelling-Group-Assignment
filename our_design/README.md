### 0.	Plot and aim of the film
Two strangers happen to cross the same path every day, it doesn’t take long until they notice one another, they start exchanging stares that become more and more intense day by day. What are they thinking about, what are their impressions of one another, are they friendly or are they hostile to each other? As the days go by the stares start to become a routine, more and more familiar to them, till one day one of the strangers doesn’t go by the usual place. What happened to him? Why didn’t he show up? How will the other stranger react?

Through this short film we are trying to show how eye contact can have very different meanings to people and the importance of it. A simple eye contact with someone can affect very differently each person. Through this film we are showing in an intense (and comedic) way how an eye contact (stare in this occasion) can affect the life of two individuals. We want our audience to be hooked but at the same time think how they would have reacted if they were on the same situation. We also did not want to make the film lengthy as we thought it would bore the audience and drive them away from the tension that has been built up. Lastly by ending the film abruptly and without a clear answer we let the viewer think and make his own conclusions and interpret the ending himself. Less is more.

### 1.	Narrative
We chose not to use any verbal narration as we thought it would take away from the tension. We wanted to build a story solely based on eye contact, facial expressions, and body movement. A verbal narration would drive away the audience and would not fit the aesthetic of our project. That’s why we used many shots and labeled each day so we could guide the audience without the use of our voices. We also wanted to let each viewer make their own assumptions on to what each person is thinking during each stare.

We also made a first day storyboard to bring our starter idea to life and a simple website.

### 2.	World
Since our story takes place in the real world, all the real-life threats and dangers apply to it. But is not all dangers and threats, we are trying to show how easily relations between people can be established with nothing more than a look. It may look threatening at first, but we can never know what the other person is actually thinking about and where it can lead to.

We tried focusing on one place for most of our shots so we could capture the daily “meeting” of our characters, we also thought that if we included many different places for our shots, during the tension build up, it would drive the audience’s attention away from our characters and their thoughts. Only later we use different places when one of the characters is alone. We are trying to show that a different shot for each of the characters means that there is something troubling them and that something is not right, something is off. We didn’t want to use different places just for aesthetic purposes, we wanted them to have a specific meaning and to connect to the characters that we created.

### 3.	Actors
There are 2 actors in the entire film, both protagonists. The guy with the glasses is Nick. Nick is a 23-year-old that’s lives alone in Syros and walks the Miaouli square on a daily basis, sometimes more than once, to get to his destinations. The other guy is Daniele. Daniele is a 24-year-old university student in the Department of Product and Systems Design Engineering, currently on his 5th year, that crosses the Miaouli square to get to his classes. Both or our characters have explosive personalities and that shows by the way they look at each other. We also included a cat for comedic relief. We thought it was fitting since it was staring at us while we were recording some of the scenes.

Meis?

#4.	Locations
The primary location of our film is obviously the Miaouli square. We filmed most of the days there using 2 wide shots and some closes ups. The last day was firstly filmed outside the cosmote building and on a small parked called Nomarchia. We used a wide shot for every scene. After that we filmed the ending scenes at the pier next to the port using a mix of shots.

### 5.	Hardware
The camera used to film all the scenes was a Blackmagic pocket cinema camera (not the 4k one). Scenes were filmed in 1920x1080 (FHD) with 180° shutter speed for cinematic motion blur (Proress codec 4.2.2) at 24 fps in order to achieve a maximum movie look. 

The lens used were a Lumix G Vario 12-60mm f/3.5-5.6 which provides a depth of field effect like the one you see in the last shot of the film.

We also used a CANON Zoom Lens FD 75-200mm 1:4.5 but none of these shots made it in the film.

### 6.	Music
For the music we used a custom track made in FL studio using free orchestral samples with LABS from Spitfire Audio.

### 7.	Camera Tricks
Some of the close ups were filmed at 30 fps (the camera's maximum) so we could replay them at 24fps making them about 20% slower. Using this technique, we managed to increase the dramatic effect and the tension build up as well as making the camera shake less intense.

### 8.	Webpage
We also made a simple site where people can learn about our project

### 9.	Storyboard
Start-up storyboard just to finalize our idea/plot.

### 10.	Editing
We used Davinci Resolve to edit the film. We color corrected all of our shots and stabilized some of them, especially the close ups in order to reduce camera shake. Lastly, we added a letterbox (the top and bottom black bars) to make some shots more dramatic (and cinematic)
